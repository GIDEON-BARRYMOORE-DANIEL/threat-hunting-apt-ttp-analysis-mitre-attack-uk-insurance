# Industry-Focused Threat Hunting & APT TTP Analysis  
### Target Sector: UK Insurance (Financial Services)

## Overview

This project presents an industry-focused threat hunting and threat intelligence analysis targeting the **United Kingdom insurance sector**. The objective is to identify Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups relevant to the industry, analyse their **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)** using the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**, and translate those findings into **actionable security controls** aligned with **NIST CSF** and **ISO/IEC 27001**.

The analysis is based exclusively on **open-source intelligence (OSINT)**, including vendor threat reports, MITRE ATT&CK documentation, and public threat intelligence platforms. Emphasis is placed on **post-compromise behaviour**, such as credential access, lateral movement, persistence, command and control, and data exfiltration.

## Scope

- Industry focus: **UK Insurance sector**
- Threat actors analysed: **Polonium, Cobalt Group, Windigo**
- Frameworks used:
  - MITRE ATT&CK (Enterprise)
  - MITRE ATT&CK Navigator
  - NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
  - ISO/IEC 27001
- Intelligence sources: Open-source vendor reports, MITRE ATT&CK, SOC-focused OSINT platforms

## Objectives

- Identify APT groups with relevance to the insurance sector  
- Map observed attacker behaviour to MITRE ATT&CK techniques  
- Visualise overlapping techniques using ATT&CK Navigator  
- Identify high-frequency attacker “choke points”  
- Align threat intelligence findings to recognised security frameworks
